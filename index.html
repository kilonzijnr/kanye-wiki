                        <p>
                            West came from a middle-class family and was reared modestly. Polaris High School in
                            Illinois is where he got his education. When he was ten years old, his family moved to
                            Nanjing, China after his mother was requested to teach as part of an exchange program. He
                            showed artistic talent at a young age. He began writing poetry when he was five years old.
                            At the tender age of 5, he began rapping, and by the time he was in the eighth grade, he had
                            written his own music.
                            When Kanye West was thirteen, he wrote the rap song "Green Eggs and Ham" as a result of his
                            growing involvement in Chicago's hip-hop culture. He got his mother to give him money so he
                            could start making recordings in a studio. She began going with him to a tiny basement
                            studio in the city, despite the fact that his mother did not want this for him. There, West
                            met No I.D., dubbed "The Godfather of Chicago Hip Hop." He quickly became West's teacher.
                            When the American Academy of Art in Chicago offered West a scholarship in 1997, he accepted
                            it to study painting before transferring to Chicago State University to study English
                            literature. He made the decision to leave college at the age of twenty in order to focus
                            solely on his aspirations of becoming a full-time rapper and musician.

                        <p>
                            West's financials were a bit of a mystery, muddled by his own exaggerations of his
                            wealth as well as of his debt: In 2016, West tweeted that he was $53 million in the
                            hole and begged Mark Zuckerberg to invest $1 billion into "Kanye West ideas." The
                            Facebook founder declined, but it didn't matter—West eventually got there himself.
                            Though West—or, as he's legally changed his name to , Ye—is one of the greatest
                            rappers and producers of his generation, he has become almost as well-known for
                            his at-times erratic behavior (including a failed presidential run in 2020 and
                            his infamous interruption of Taylor Swift at the 2009 MTV , often complicated by his
                            struggles with bipolar disorder.
                            His love life has also kept him in the spotlight, and his ongoing divorce proceedings
                            from estranged wife Kim Kardashian may put his life—and his finances—under a
                            stronger microscope than ever before.
                            From earning $5,000 for a beat for Jermaine Dupri to millions for his own tours to
                            astronomical sums for his Yeezy clothing line, here's what we know about Kanye
                            West's net worth and how Ye earned his fortune so far.
                            Brace yourself: Ye was once worth an estimated whopping $2 billion. Yes, with a B!
                            However, with his Yeezy brand with Adidas taking up a good $1.5 billion of that sum,
                            his net worth is now estimated at $400 million, per Forbes, since the German-based
                            brand ended the partnership.
